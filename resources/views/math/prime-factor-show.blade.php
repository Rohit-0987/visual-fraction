                        Looking to get a list of the prime factors of {{ $num1 }}? In this article we'll give

                        {{ $num1 }}, how to calculate the prime factors of {{ $num1 }} (also known as
                        the prime factorization of {{ $num1 }}). As a bonus, we'll also list out the prime
                        factor tree of {{ $num1 }} the product of prime factors of {{ $num1 }}, and tell
                        you how many prime factors {{ $num1 }} has.</p>

                        <p>Every number can be represented as a product of prime numbers. So when we talk aqbout prime
                            factorization of {{ $num1 }}, we're talking about the building blocks of the
                            number. A prime factor is a positive integer that can only be divided by 1 and itself. The
                            prime factors of {{ $num1 }} are all of the prime numbers in it that when multipled
                            together will equal {{ $num1 }}.

                        <p>You'll often see the process of finding prime factors of {{ $num1 }} referred to as
                            prime factorization. To get the prime factors of {{ $num1 }} we need to divide
                            {{ $num1 }} by the smallest prime number possible. You then repeat the same process
                            by taking the result and dividing that number by the smallest prime number. Eventually, you
                            end up with the number 1.

                        <p>This process creates something called a prime factor tree of {{ $num1 }}. The prime
